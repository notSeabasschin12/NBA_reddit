We allowed the switch on the 1-5 PnR all night long, which allowed Kemba to be matched up with Bobby Portis and Randle.  Its OK to accept the switch sometimes when Mitch is on the floor because he can sag off and still be a threat to block the shot, but once he got hurt we needed to adjust (meaning, fight hard over screens and talk on defense).... 

I expected some sort of adjustment from the coaching staff...  we had the same problem back in 2014 with Woodson - we just didnt have the defensive personnel to switch on all PnRs.  The Celtics continuously created matchup advantages.  Kemba or Tatum are going to score on Portis/Randle way more often than not.

Our free throw shooting will revert to the mean, we actually have decent shooters on our team this year.

There's 2 separate factions on this roster now. The veterans Randle/Morris/Portis who are playing for a fat contract and the youth Frank/RJ/Knox/DSJ/Dotson/Trier who are trying to prove they belong in the NBA. 

You can tell by the rotations on defense and the lack of ball movement that these guys do not consistently play as a cohesive unit.  The 1st half we looked great because the ball was moving and the defense was swarming. 2nd half didn't start out hot and we had 0 momentum and guys did not play with confidence. Once there is no confidence everything breaks down for us.  

Last year we had great chemistry with the youth because even tho everyone knew they'd be moving on, the guys seemed to really like each other and being in the situation of being underdogs. Now with the veteran presence everyone know we should be getting more wins and being more competitive, so the chemistry is just terrible. Our late game execution is awful.

People can rag on Phil all they want - He wanted to sell high on Porzingis.  We could have had a king's haul for him at the time, even when it was clear there were attitude issues and that he likely wouldn't be a #1 option. Phil was old, lazy, and stubborn but he saw what we didn't at the time in KP.  Remember the hauls they were talking about with him?  We would be a playoff team right now if we had pulled the trigger then.  Everyone was (somewhat deliriously) thinking Porzingis could be a generational player.

its hard to justify playin him sometimes down the stretch when he bricks everything but overall hes a + to the team compared to how this shit looks like with the starters. 

overall good win because this game is a very clear proof of the difference between 2 different lineups and that puttin all the ""best"" players together dont mean shit in basketball its more about balance and ball iq.

very frustrated still cuz of what frank provides to the team, if he could have just a decent game aka put up 10-12pts  and  make those open 3s that i know he can cuz sometimes we see him bein fluid he would be so far ahead of payton and dsj in term of starting.

i just hope fizdale is not delusional and actually see the pattern in this game and how the units on the floor played. hope he doesnt think startin who he started was the right choice and that they just ""focused"" to comeback from it.

I think its possible that Kevin Knox and/or Frank Ntilkina could be in the deal. 

Id rather Kevin Love than watch Randle. He would bring the experience

Demar Derozan has a player option. Hes a Canada guy. He'd simply be mentoring RJ. If the Knicks squeeze lets say 20 wins together and fall to 5th in the draft, that probably means Derozan would want to stick around. 

The FA class is so weak. If Love or Derozan make too much money, so be it. With the pick, RJ and Derozan, maybe that gets them in the room with AD. 

If there is any talk of trading the 2020 pick, Dolan needs to sell tomorrow. 

If I knew Derozan was picking up his option, I'd be fine putting in the 2021 pick via putting 3 point shooting around said team with the remaining cap space. Again, weak free agent class. 6th thru 8th are probably up for grabs again next year.

He was the reason for almost all of their turnovers in the first half and had a good offensive game. Of course tonight would be the night Snell goes perfect from the field. Kennard didnt shoot well though so I guess it balances out a bit but if you let your opponent shoot 50/50 on fg and 3s youre gonna have a bad time. Everything fell apart with randles flagrant though. It was a bullshit call but was a foul and we make way too many dumb fouls. We need more discipline there and hopefully they are getting coached on it. Portis  and randle together are a cancer on defense. Its as bad or worse than everyone said it would be. Randle was ok on offense but portis not hitting shots makes him basically useless. From the start of the season turnovers are down and assists are up so thats encouraging. We actually shot alright but not enough when Detroit shoots the lights out. 

 Im not convinced fizdale is the problem but hes part of it and def not getting everything out of this team.

Before he went out with two fouls we were holding steady with Sacramento and the bottom fell out when he came out.   A teams offense can only be designed to get switches if the defending team's scheme features switches.  If you let Frank run through screens and trail the guard into the rim protector - almost no one can score on the Frank Mitch combo.   

Frank also had 3 assists in 14 minutes so would have had 7 or so if he had played the 37 minutes he did in Boston.

Instead, they allow Randle to be the focal point of the offense and everything slows to a crawl. They even let him bring up the ball as if he's a point forward of some sort even though he doesn't have the vision for it. 

Barrett, Ntilikina, Dotson, Trier, Knox, DSJ, and even Brazdeikis should be getting run, literally. 

The Knicks should be playing a tight 8-9 man rotation and should be playing some 10 seconds or less basketball.

Right now, the Knicks coaches have to teach their young guys how play in transition, proper spacing, and how to fill the floor. 

The offensive spacing the Knicks have right now is embarrassing with barely any off-the-ball movement.

It makes me question if there is even an offensive system in place other than give it to Randle or Morris to isolate and hope they pass the ball.

In 09/10 we bribed a team to take Jared Jeffries' contract  to open more cap so we could sign Lebron and a friend maybe and ended up with Amar'e (tragic!). 

IN 2014/15, Phil Jackson used Tyson Chandler and Shumpert as bribes to get out JR Smith and Ray Felton's deals... we ended up signing a bunch of one year contracts (Derrick Williams and Aron Afflalo!) and Robin Lopez.

Thanks to our decision to preserve cap room in 2015 by signing one year deals, we were able to sign Joakim Noah and Courtney Lee to multi-year deals.

All of these big cap space summers have been somewhere between kinda bad and tragic... yet there were again doing the same idiotic thing... bribing our way into more cap space because history is not worth paying attention to or learning from.

In evaluating these options, consider what hte Knicks could have gotten instead of cap room with the chips they've used to bribe their way out of contracts AND consider again what they could have done in terms of absorbing bad contracts to add picks had they chosen not to sing whomever they could after options A, B and C proved fantasies.","[Post Game Thread] Knicks get smacked by the Bucks wire-to-wire 123-102, to fall to 7-23",https://www.reddit.com/r/NYKnicks/comments/edzg83/post_game_thread_knicks_get_smacked_by_the_bucks/,,0.140538162,

You know, kinda like that post-nut feeling, where you devote 2+ hrs of your time to the thing you waited for all day in hopes of achieving happiness, but in the end, you just feel so cold and empty inside.

I'm actually pleasantly surprised by RJ's 3pt stroke so far, but I hope as the season progresses that he can develop a face up game and start knocking down some midrange j's. This team overall doesn't look too bad, just a lot of low iq plays and lack of chemistry thus far that hopefully can be cleaned up.

Edit; also its pretty much round robin. By the end of the season sos pretty much evens out across each conference and the odds of better record are in the west since they hold edge in conference v conference matchups. Pace does matter in that case cause everybody pretty closely approximates the same schedule by the end of the year.

Fiz not starting an actual PG: stupid and a very Fiz-eque move


Randle: if he can limit his stupid defensive fouls and avoid putting the ball on the paint for more than a second we are all going to be very happy. 20/10/5 seems reachable


Morris: was a genius in the first half and a net negative in the second half. 


Peyton: looked great tbh


DSJ: looked bad


Frank: found a way to look worse, in a shorter amount of time


Knox: he is really bad on defense. If he cant get the job done on his defensive assignments, it wouldnt matter if hes shouting 40% from 3 bc hes a fucking sieve that fouls.


RJ: I mean, I dont want to say anything too positive bc I dont want to jinx things but he looks like a cornerstone at 19. FT situation aint great.

I don't mind having Gibson for a veteran presence, granted his deal isn't exactly the most team friendly for what we're getting out of him on the court.

Losing Vonleh for Portis makes no sense whatsoever. Check out [this comparison](http://bkref.com/tiny/woqx3) of Vonleh last year vs. Portis this year. They're putting up very close numbers. No way that makes the Portis signing look good, especially since Vonleh was making $1.6 million with us last season.

Someone might say, ""Well, maybe Portis was playing much better last season to earn that contract, and has gotten worse with us."" [Here's what Portis and Vonleh both did last year](http://bkref.com/tiny/khIrV). Those numbers don't look all that different.

Okay now this. Frank comes in. Tries to run the offense. Brings the ball up, blah blah. Randle calls for the ball. He does what he does. Now. Repeat. Frank, runs offense, brings the ball up. Then Randle not trusting Frank. Does what he does. Brings the balls up. Ignores the open man. Whether its Kev or Marcus, RJ too. Even through that lil four game 30 pt streak he was still doing dumb ass shit. And the Loss vs the suns? Tuh. Fucking CHUCKKK

You dont let a team who's been hot all night shoot the 3. Its dumb its stupid. 

Yes if they hit 2 free throws you tie the game. But you get the ball back and you take the final shot. 

You either win or go to OT. Both options are better than a loss.

It's been more than enough time including his Memphis stint to judge Fizdale. He fucking stinks. What a terrible hire by Mills and Perry. The sad thing is that pretty much everyone in this subreddit knew it was a shit choice yet most of us remained hopeful (including myself), for whatever reason.

We really had a shot at Bud and Blatt. Bud AT WORST is a top 10 coach and better than Fiz could ever dream of at coaching. I don't give a micro-fuck about ""players coaches"" and having a personality and saying the right thing and all that bullshit. Can you coach some damn basketball, yes or no? We should have locked Bud in a room and met all of his demands on our way to a hire. What a joke that our FO let that opportunity slip. Even Blatt would have a far more creative hire, though he sadly has MS now and i'm not even sure if he's coaching anymore.

I don't give a shit about a revolving door of coaches until we actually get the right one, though I don't think a competent FO would need a revolving door to find the right one. If I could snap my fingers right now and replace Fiz with one of Becky Hammon, Mike Miller or Dave Joerger, I'd do it in a millisecond. Though if I had the resources our FO does I would research the shit out of the coaching market before that.

On the flip side. Trier looked awful, Frank was playing like a scared rookie, and DSJ doesn't look like an NBA player (hopefully he's still hurt/not in game shape).

I think the biggest negative I have is Fizdale. If he actually made a decision on PG we may have been playing much closer through much of the game. His decision of RJ/Trier was so bad he himself gave up on it within a few minutes.

Then his coaching during the stretch was brutal. We lost Randle for a few minutes and he basically allowed the Spurs to have their way with us.

We dont have an all-star or a full blown close out guy, but I have 2 real issues here: 1 - our best defender didnt even get an opportunity to play at all, why didnt we use him, if Frank has proven anything, even if you dont think hes proven shit and he sucks, he has shut down very good nba players multiple times, he played the best out of the team against Harden when he went off, he shut down Trae Young, and he shut down Kemba on team USA, you have Kyrie in the game, throw our best defender at him. 

2 - where the fuck are the end of game plays? He knows how to call a floppy which is why we got bailed out and were able to come back, and people will blame Randle, but the fact that Randle is running an iso at the top of the 3 point line when he has yet to even score in that kind of situation, while the possession before Marcus Morris is taking a step back 3 (the fuck?), shows me the coach isnt putting them in the right position against the right players. And it isnt like its rookies fucking up, those are two vets who both know how to execute. Why not bring in Trier who was hot and can create his own shot?

I also havent scratched my head at a rotation in the games Ive seen so far. We also arent just running Floppys out of desperation like anyone would do in 2K which is big. 

Also kind of want to point out these guys backgrounds: Fizdale was an assistant coach on 5 teams since 1998, landed his first HC job in 2016 on the Grizzlies - he was fired for a multitude of reasons. 

Miller was an assistant on 3 college teams 1989-1994, was the HC of Texas State for 6 years, where he did had an 87-79 record, made the tournament once. Coached Eastern Illinois and did a poor job tbh, was an assistant for UC Riverside and an assistant on the Spurs G-League team for 2 years, before being HC of the Westchester Knicks for 4 years and winning coach of the year in 17-18, getting promoted as an assistant to Fiz and then we end up here. 

Simply put, Miller has done this way longer, has seen the game change, and learned what adapting is, found success, found failure, and then found success again, and has worked with hundreds of different players at 3 different levels.

Not too upset with a lot of the last play decisions, low post to Randle for a shot at getting contact and going to the line/high percentage shot, and as easy as it is to point at Randle in the clutch, we're still hurting for bigs, missing FTs, and still fouling too much.

That said...

The good:

3PT% - 17/25, y'all. Knox, Barrett, Trier, Payton, Morris, Ellington, all 50% or more. Knox 4 of 4 to keep us in the game at some clutch times, RJ definitely picking his spots better, Trier just being the offensive weapon we know he's capable of and of course Ellington...We jumped on him last game, but he got those catch and shoot looks on the curl and made his money tonight.

Steals - 14 to their 10. Yeah, the half court offensive sets need work still, but Fiz said he wants pace, he wants transition, and that's easy buckets for us to get into the open floor and convert.

RJ - pretty quiet first, solid second. Believe in him getting those FTs down in time. Defense again is better than advertised.

Elfrid - Don't feel like we saw a ton of him in the second, but again, he got out there and when folks weren't respecting his shot, he made them pay a few times. Again, don't see him as the PG of the future for this squad, but right now, he's definitely the floor general for the starts and with this being a PG heavy draft class, I can see him mentoring if we go that route.

Trier - What'd he do, like 12 points in 10 minutes initially? If this team needs points, he's out there creating his own shot, and with our PG by committee, that makes him fit in nicely.

Knox - He's been looking so vastly improved, especially on the catch and shoot. If he gets used to using his size and length for man defense, he might just slip into the starting rotation.

DOG MENTALITY - Two games when we've been down by a bunch, two games where we've battled back and made it close. The toughness was on display, the defensive ethos isn't consistent, but when it pops in, they look locked in.

The bad:

The fouls - Mitch in foul trouble for this first appearance this year, along with Randle &amp; Trier all with 5. A couple of technicals in there too for this squad.

The turnovers - We had less, but so many of them were at momentum changing moments.

Taj - I know he's better than this, chalking it up to an off night and a few balls not bouncing the right way/lack of communication on boards.

The ugly:

PG by committee - Gave Payton his props, but besides that...Don't take it the wrong way, but I hope DSJ is still recovering from that injury and getting his legs back, and that this is the floor that we'll see from him this year. I want that confidence back, I want that dynamic offensive guy back because with the way things are looking now, teams will respect that player driving, and if Ellington/Knox are going to be second unit snipers, that's a good balance on the offensive end. No Frank tonight, which makes me wonder what's going on in practice and such, but I still believe that he'll get his chances. Trier at the 1 for a couple of sets wasn't too bad, teams respect him at all 3 levels so the less he tunnel visions and is able to set guys up, the better, and yeah, RJ toward the end at G in that small lineup looked fine, but I don't see either of those guys at the 1 full time any time soon.

4 and 5 - Going to give these guys credit and say that some of our rebounding issues were due to lack of communication (and some lack of effort as well). A lot of these guys are coming back from injuries and such, so maybe that's also hampering them. But yeah, on offense, the post play wasn't as good as it looked on other nights, Mitch's foul trouble and lack of minutes from that, etc Randle tonight...uhh...I do think Fiz is right that Randle might be better suited as a point forward, but part of that is going to be him being more eager/aware to pass out of those post up opportunities, especially when he draws help defenders.

&amp;#x200B;

\--Overall, this was a winnable game, sure, but that's two games (technically) on the road against playoff teams where we've held our own and put up a fight. This team doesn't have a star that we can draw up a play for in the clutch, we have a guy that many think could be that guy and another who is still earning his stripes in the league. We also have a bunch of others with well defined roles. Still meshing together, still only game 2 of 82, still 6 returning, still 9 new, still getting hope from what I'm seeing in the team's growth as individuals, and hoping that we communicate more on both sides of the ball.","[Post-Game Thread] The Brooklyn Nets (1-1) defeat the New York Knicks (0-2), 113-109",https://www.reddit.com/r/NYKnicks/comments/dn7q58/postgame_thread_the_brooklyn_nets_11_defeat_the/,,0.305285716,

&amp;#x200B;

We have too many players who need minutes to have players with this level of effort. The knicks should not be playing  like that ever. Are they partying too much in when they are at home? That would at least make some sense to me. But if dudes don't want to play hard on defense then they shouldn't be playing. 

You can see why the spurs despite having a bad season have been so good for so long, they really play things the right way. Frank who had a very good game, they were sagging off him extremely hard, and dared him to make a couple threes, he got one at the end, but they were able to heavily sag off him all game, and it made a difference.

We don't have enough people who can handle the ball well. DSJR dis well this game, Frank is decent, but cannot consistently penetrate, Payton could, but he's injured (that injury has been way worse for this team than people realize) Rj can a little. And that means we are gonna have some guys dribbling too much to compensate for this. Consequentially, Randle, and Morris are asked to dribble the ball more than they should. However, they need to do it less, or smarter. Morris needs to primarily take 3s. Like I said, I really don't mind if he makes some iso plays, but just limit them a little, just make a pass if you're doubled, that's all i ask for him. With Randle, if he is guarded one on one and gets a little momentum, i don't mind him going for it. But he needs to be a roll man, he needs to make off ball cuts. I don't even mind him taking open threes, hell, i dont mind him dribbling into three defenders twice a game, but he does it sooooo much. The coaching and Randle needs a little bit more creativity than just give him the ball, and see what happens.

HOw do we let so many good shooters get open from three? When stars beat you its one thing, but role players beating us is what gets me. Trey Lyles and Patty Mills, fucking destroying us from three was actually the difference between this game, and a competitive game. This one is on the coaching staff. We need to be able to defend the three point line better. And then we also need to be able to defend the paint a little better when they start destroying us from three, I feel like with Robinson, we should not have a problem locking up the paint a bit more, dude is a monster.

On to the next one. I imagine since we just played a game, our guys won't party too hard tonight, so they won't be hungover for the game tomorrow, but who knows.","[Post-Game Thread] The San Antonio Spurs (6-11) defeat the New York Knicks (4-12), 111-104",https://www.reddit.com/r/NYKnicks/comments/e0so3l/postgame_thread_the_san_antonio_spurs_611_defeat/,,0.311558941,

Even more furious probably since signing vet FAs is a signal that the team believes it can compete this year. Now, fans are even more disappointed after buying into the notion that the team might be vaguely competitive.

As far as the idea that hte KNicks didn't spend on big long term vet contracts... neither did Phil Jackson. This FO is very similar to PJ with some small upgrades -- it signs its 2nd roundrs to multi-year deals (phil signed guys for 1 year) and it gives the vet FAs team options instead of player options like Phil did.

The other thing is you can't compare the KNicks of today to the Knicks of like 15 years ago when they were signing idiotic contracts. The NBA has changed. The luxury tax is more punishing and contracts are shorter and teams as a whole are smarter. Relative to the rest of the league, the Knicks are just as out of touch as they were back in the Isiah days. Other teams have gotten smarter and so have the Knicks. The distance between them is similar.","[Post Game Thread] The Sacramento Kings (2-5) exterminate the @ New York Knicks (1-6), 113 - 92",https://www.reddit.com/r/NYKnicks/comments/draeuh/post_game_thread_the_sacramento_kings_25/,,0.339655058,

In three minutes he had two bad turnovers and two plays that shouldve gone his way if Taj could make a dunk and the refs called a goaltend. His turnovers came at an inopportune time and were terrible, but it happens.
 
DSJ continues to launch long 2s early in the shot clock and giving zero effort on defense. Its his MO and its alarming because as a super athletic PG he should be getting to the rim constantly and making plays as the defense collapses, but he doesnt seem to be interested in that or trying on D.

Frank sucks on offense dont get me wrong, but tonight he made two mistakes in three minutes and got pulled while everyone else seems to have a much longer leash. Hell Ellington played 13 minutes and got zero separation and still chucked awful contested threes while doing not much else.

But, he was mostly irrelevant on offense and was struggling to keep up with Korver and Middleton on defense. The kid looks lost when he's on the floor most nights. He should have been sent down to the G-League a while ago to get his game right. And the Knicks development team should be flushed. Maybe they should have kept Longstaff... He's the only one whoever got any results. And now he works for the Bucks, btw.

As for vets versus youth, I agree we could give more minutes to our young guys. But comparing us to Memphis isn't fair. First Memphis still has vets getting big minutes. And that's good. That's how you develop a team. You mix young talent with guys who know what they're doing on the floor and can lead/teach. Gibson and Morris are that for us. But, the Grizz have the benefit of seeing their young guys are producing.

Our young guys, however, outside of Robinson, stink. (Though Frank and RJ are showing some progress.)

Then you got guys like Randle and Portis who are both youngish but nobody expects will be here long. But, Randle is one of our better players so he gets playing time.

The only highlight from this game is Knox shows he's stepping outside of what his game was in mid range and we need to continue to blend in into a defensive player as he works on that. No more catch and shoot. The team needs more from him.

2) Seeing Morris take it to the Spurs was awesome.  Obviously we can't expect him to get 26 every night, but his jumper was wet and we did a good job of getting him the ball when he was feeling it.  That said, at one point he was 8-10 but only made 1 shot after that ending up 9-18.  That's not a great sign for consistency, and we should have addressed it rather than letting him keep throwing up bricks.  The initial scoring was a great sign, but the following inefficiency is a good sign that he won't be much more than a good role player.

3) Frankie frank.  Damn man.  He comes on the court and in 3 possessions turns it over twice and is responsible for a 3 pt play on the other end twice as well.  He got benched immediately, as he should have been, but damn that is pretty disappointing stuff.  While it's only a really short amount of  game time, this kind of error is going to hurt his chances of getting any significant playing time soon a lot.  These two turnovers were simply a result of really, really bad play from him.  They were lazy and ill conceived passes.  Where did FIBA Frank go?

4) Payton looked like a serviceable PG out there.  Aside from his 5 fouls he had a really stellar game.  If he keeps it up he can definitely shape into the PG of our future.

5) Kevin Knox - we saw this in preseason but he's looking deadly from the outside.  This is exactly the kind of thing we need around RJ Barrett.  As is usually the case, if he can make his defense not a complete liability, a starting lineup that included Randle and Knox could be really nasty.

6) Fouls and TOs.  We doubled the number of fouls of the spurs.  This is just unacceptable.  It's sloppy and hurt us big.  We had 3 players with 5 fouls and one with 4.  Between those four that's more than the entire Spurs team combined.  On the flipside we protected the ball pretty well.  Despite Frank being absolute garbage and getting two TOs in two minutes, we had a -7 differential in TOs to the spurs.  That seems pretty solid to me with such a young core.

7) Steals - we obviously stole the ball really well last night.  We can't expect to keep up those kind of numbers, but it's definitely encouraging that we were able to force turnovers and score off of them.",[Post Game Thread] Knicks lose to the Spurs 120-111 (10/23/19),https://www.reddit.com/r/NYKnicks/comments/dmad3s/post_game_thread_knicks_lose_to_the_spurs_120111/,,0.368741866,

After the deadline, and whatever moves are made, the younger guys will see heavier minutes. I don't understand why that's such a hard concept for people here to grasp.

Having so many guys on one-year deals makes it imperative that we try to get any value from them that we can. Would we have been better off using some of our cap space to acquire other teams' more undesirable contracts (packaged with picks and other young players for our trouble)? Most likely. I don't know how much our FO chasing the high-profile FA pipedream played into whether we could have gone with that kind of approach (maybe most of the kinds of moves like that to be made had already been done at that point by teams savvier than us), but doing that would have allowed us the opportunity to be freer in giving the young guys more playing time.

People say this like they don't watch NBA games. Do you think other NBA point guards are just isolating against their primary defender all game? This is why individual point guard defense is overrated. The entire teams offense is designed to get switches. The entire point is that Frank literally can't do anything to stop Fox because it's the easiest thing in today's league to switch onto another defender. 

That's why the team has largely played the same with Frank on defense. His defensive rating (how the team does defensively with him on the court) is the same as Dennis Smith and worse than Payton and RJ.

Most teams switch like this against guards like fox.

A lot of coaching and lineup picking I understand is a crapshoot. When it feels regular or consistent is when we should be worried, right? Anything that should cause us to be more hopeful?

With all of that said, Im still not in favor of firing fizdale mid season. I dont think hes an actual detriment to anyone we should be caring about i actually think hes doing fine with our younger players.

&gt;Managing the politics with James Dolan and Steve Mills is what I worry about.

They have proven that they have no idea what a legitimate rebuild entails and instead of taking a measured approach after KD predictably snubbed the Knicks, they panicked by deciding to scrap the rebuild and prioritize trying to put together a 35 win roster this season instead. They grossly overpaid a bunch of role players who are veteran minimum guys and worst of all, gave Randle $20 mil per season for multiple years despite the fact that this team was nowhere near ready to win.

This Front Office could have maintained cap flexibility throughout the season, which would've made the Knicks an ideal suitor for the many buyers who will desperately try to get rid of cap space at the trading deadline so they can acquire an upgrade or prepare themselves for free agency. But rather than do that, this front office did the opposite and threw money at what they figured would be ""quick fixes."" In reality, that has obviously been anything but the case.

Insanity is doing the same things over and over again and expecting different results. I believe this front office will take that exact approach and overpay the Otto Porter Jr.'s of the world this offseason should they not get fired into the sun. The Knicks desperately need a front office that is committed to drafting and developing young talent and acquiring premium assets such as draft picks so that this team can be set up to succeed in the long run.",Post Game Thread - Knicks lose to the Nets 103-101,https://www.reddit.com/r/NYKnicks/comments/e18kgr/post_game_thread_knicks_lose_to_the_nets_103101/,,0.429816862,

The last team to win a championship had 2 of the best defensive wings in the league, and possibly the best defensive center in the league that held Embiid to 0 points this season.

Fans generally dont understand the importance of defensive wings and defense because of high scores, because defense is important in the last couple minutes. If we can have a guy who can steal an inbound pass and get two points, doesnt really even matter how good he is at the rim because that can be a guaranteed 2 points depending on where you are on the court. We have won games where guys went off, Curry had 54 against us and we beat the Warriors. If you look at it like how many PPG does player C have + how many points did he stop the other team from scoring + how many possessions did he add to his offense + Easy points hes adding more than the X amount of points hes scoring.

Only thing I can think of is some motivation tactics or mind games depending on how negatively you want to view him. Starting trier might have been to show trier that we value him after not playing him in preseason much, or maybe he hopes thinks he can change his habits and make him a distributor, like a poor mans harden. Maybe he just wanted another shooter on the floor, which i dont agree with but whatever. 

Overall I think we did well though and I dont think Fiz had anything too glaring with lineups down the stretch. Fans always think they know when to call a timeout and what the best lineup is but youre also working against a champion coach and a playoff team and you have a roster that has the talent for around 30 wins. I dont think people appreciate how hard that is. 

As for Frank, people are going to pile on to him for things that arent his fault, and its tough to come in cold late in the game but still he was booty and as much as I love him its hard to defend him tonight. 1st of all, he didnt kill the momentum, the momentum was disappearing when he came in. He set Taj up for a dunk that missed and got robbed for 2 by a uncalled goal tend.

He looks like he is continually going against his instincts. He almost immediately runs back on offense after shots, and he boxes out rather than going for contested boards on D. Even his shot blocking seems to be halfhearted and reluctant.  
   
Prior to the coaching change he had an offensive rebounding % of 14.0%, defensive rebounding % of 20.3% and total rebounding % of 16.9%. Shot blocking was at 9.2%.  

Following the coaching change those numbers are ORB 11.7%, DRB% 16.4%, and TRB 13.9%. Block rate down to 5.9%. Numbers down across the board.   
  
His fouls were at 6.2 per 36 under Fizdale and 5.2 per 36 under Miller.  So it is working to reduce his fouling. But he doesn't seem to be in flow or rhythm, and it shows in the numbers.

Naturally great defensive players thanks to incredible athleticism, wingspan, and defensive mentality. They have drastically improved their offensive skills overtime to become great 2-way players.

Devin Booker, James Harden, Trae Young. Great at scoring but you can tell that, even if they slightly improve their defense, it will never be a drastic change, they'll never make it to an all defensive team.

RJ, Mitch and Frank have put in consistent effort and have certain things they do consistently well. Sadly Fizdale is not putting them in positions to succeed if we're going off of this game.

&amp;#x200B;

Why is Mitch, one of the best vertical spacers in the NBA, handing off the ball to our power forwards beyond the arc instead of running to the rim as a PnR threat? I can't understand this dumbfuck logic with these useless hand off's we run.

RJ seem to drive into a crowded paint consisting of Randle and Portis far too often, Randle should stay the fuck out of there. Portis should never step inside the 3 point arc, ever. He almost shoots worse from in there than he does from 3.

Frank, I just wish we stopped force feeding him 3's. maybe he'll finish the season hitting 34-36% but he's obviously so much more comfortable in a simple PnR, or a midrange post up on smaller guards. He gets fouled cause of his length as well.

I'll add that we need to run more off ball screens for Knox to come off of and he needs to make up his mind the moment he gets the ball. He hesitates with everything he does. Try and get him open and tell him to take it without any repercussions. He can be valuable at his size, but I do think his future is at PF.","[Post-Game Thread] The San Antonio Spurs (6-11) defeat the New York Knicks (4-12), 111-104",https://www.reddit.com/r/NYKnicks/comments/e0so3l/postgame_thread_the_san_antonio_spurs_611_defeat/,,0.483984489,

* I am happy when I see Frank, Mitch or Knox perform well.

* I must admit that Miller has them playing solid defense and I really like the spacing and ball movement.

* However, the Knicks really need to improve their three point shooting (which may involve getting better shooters at some point).

* If Miller (and Blatt I guess) are able to get a respectable record out of the rest of this season, does this sub change their minds about Mills and/or Perry?

* I did not like the way Breen was pronouncing Bullock. I mean if that's how Reggie Bullock wants his last name pronounced then so be it, but, like... why??

* The Knicks better get a good return for Marcus Morris. He is often their best player.

* Completely not Knicks related, but I really want the Giants to hire Josh McDaniels and I am going to laugh my ass off if they actually do end up hiring him and the Giants fans go all Daniel Jones on them again.","[Post Game Thread] Knicks (10-24) blow out the Blazers (14-21) in MSG 117-93 to extend the win streak to 3 (January 1, 2020)",https://www.reddit.com/r/NYKnicks/comments/eis26x/post_game_thread_knicks_1024_blow_out_the_blazers/,,0.486272813,

That's not a terrible thing - he has room to grow, as do all young players.   


* He's gotta get better at going right, well-organized mid-season defenses will lock down the left. He needs to counter because if he keeps trying to go left, that's where we'll see the efficiency drop. I'm relatively confident with his work ethic he'll sort this out.  

* While he's a solid PNR passer for his age (he leverages his size well, can beat the trap), his timing needs work. He can be a beat or two late on some of his passes, making for more difficult shots.   

* His FT shooting is really concerning, both on its own and in terms of what it means for his 3pt shooting  


There are lots of other areas he can improve that I wouldn't call flaws either. His handle is solid, but not particularly special. He turns the ball over at a good clip (rookie problem). He's not exactly an off the dribble jump shot threat yet. Lot of potential for growth.

Its a tricky situation because the team clearly plays its best with Morris and randle on different rotations, but they seem to have to close the game together which creates some difficulty :/ 

We need to figure out how to score in crunch time, I believe in miller for this. Also we just had that stretch early in the game where we could not stop them from driving to the rim, we could also do better for that.

Dotson has a bad 7 minutes but we really need him to keep more shooting on the floor. An out of bounds call went our way when it shouldnt have, but I really thought we were getting mostly unfavorable calls especially Mitchs foul on jokic. 

Frank played really well, elf is really fun to watch when hes put in a position to move the ball when were playing fast.

Barrett played poorly, the one thing to say about him, is he is absolutely not getting foul calls that he should be. I recall at least twice this game he got straight up hit and he got absolutely nothing. Really puts him in a bad position when driving to the rim is his best skill. I am fairly confident hes going to be a good player, but its gonna take a little time.

I'm very happy with Frank Ntilikina's development so far. I've said this before but he seems much more confident and it looks like he's figured out what type of player he wants to be. And I know his offensive stats aren't very impressive, but he had a couple of really nice offensive highlights in the second half. He led the team in minutes tonight with 35 which seems telling to me btw.

I also think this sub is too negative lately. The team was predicted to win 25-30 games so I don't understand all the angst about wins and loses right now. I mean they lost this game on a miracle 3 point shot with 2.7 seconds. It was heavily contested too. So they lost but who cares? What I am happy about is that their core of young players are starting to develop really well. RJ Barret, Mitchell Robinson, Frank Ntilikina, Kevin Knox and Damyean Dotson all look to be progressing nicely to me. Could be a very nice defensive team in the future.

I think the Fiz hate has gone overboard too. No one is claiming that he's an offensive mastermind, but we knew that when he came here. He wants to focus on conditioning and team defense so let him do that. I'd like to maybe bring in another high priced assistant to help out with the offense maybe. Doc Rivers had Tom Thibadeau when he was with the Celtics and I think he has Mike Woodson now. Steve Kerr had Alvin Gentry and then Luke Walton. If getting an offensive coordinator type of coach is going to help, I'd rather do that then change coaches every year. There's no salary cap on coaches as far as I know.",Post Game Thread - Knicks fall to the Hornets,https://www.reddit.com/r/NYKnicks/comments/dxh1r5/post_game_thread_knicks_fall_to_the_hornets/,,0.523117942,

The quick way to being competitve is grabbing a max guy. Quickest way is to get 2 of em. But if we get 1 next year, and RJ and Mitch improve(maybe knox too), and payton is a servicable PG, we're in the playoffs. We hit on our draft pick(s) and the year after we're a contender. We get 2 max guys and we're a top 3team in the east.

Now it's all easier said than done, considering top players have been vocal about their disdain for our ownership. But the traditional break it down and rebuild formula isn't necessarily the only formula to sucess in teh NBA. As a matter of fact, building around a max player is actually the prominent formula. We gotta get one of these super studs to come here.

While there were some great contests where the Nuggets still ended up scoring anyways, it seems like we're playing on autopilot without a care in the world. Nobody on the Knicks appear to care that we're down by this much. The Nuggets are getting wide open looks and the Knicks are simply not contesting shots even though they're in a position to do so. I'm fine with us losing by simply not having enough talent while we tank, but it's frustrating to watch when players aren't even trying.","[Post Game Thread] Knicks drop to 4-18, losing to the Nuggets at home by a score of ""Holy"" - ""Shit""",https://i.redd.it/b7b8s6z8dx241.gif,,0.553278258,

Got to get Barrett to make the plays in the last 2-3 minutes. I hope the team learns something on how to make a run in the 3rd. Randle needs to put more want into it, he was a bit unfocused tonight. Fizdale's strategy at the 2 minute mark didn't succeed, Pop's did.

We might have to be patient here, when there's time to think rationally, there's a lot of possibilities to explore, I would not say or suggest right now, but Fiz can still be beneficial for a bit time more (in terms of skill development). I think it could be better to bring in a new Offensive coach coordinator or someone for the staff. It shouldn't be that hard to teach a motion offense. You can teach that in a week. I learned a lot of the basic motions and offensive movement principles in just a few days.

We also need to put more attention on the Assistant coaches, not just Fizz. In terms of realistic choices to replace, it's tough to discuss right now. Stability could be more important, we have to try a bit harder not to over over react. I've seen worse losses, except for the part where we shot ourselves a lot in the foot. And we definitely should play Frank, and definitely play Brazdeikis and Dotson more. Iggy can help a lot with the ball chemistry and maybe on D because of his size (I think he's bigger than RJ and similar speeds / mobility).",[Post Game Thread] The Boston Celtics(2-1) defeat the New York Knicks(0-3),https://www.reddit.com/r/NYKnicks/comments/dnn9q9/post_game_thread_the_boston_celtics21_defeat_the/,,0.607453991,

We all look at Morris putting up crazy shots and Randle making his dumb decisions, but lowkey we don't notice Portis with the team low -14 and he was the centre on the court when we got run on at the end of the 3rd. I can live with Morris taking some insane shots and making some if we can also have at least one of Gibson and Meech to hold it down on the defensive end, but Portis clogs up our big man rotation off the bench.

Also you can just feel the difference through most of the game with Frank on vs off the court. The defense is energised, he takes mostly good makeable shots and he looks to run in transition. DSJ shot well but the offense went stagnant with him runnng the point which was part of the run we had on us in the 3rd which ended up losing the game.",Post Game Thread - Knicks choke a 17 point lead to lose to the 76ers,https://www.reddit.com/r/NYKnicks/comments/dzcii5/post_game_thread_knicks_choke_a_17_point_lead_to/,,0.611706014,

I absolutely agree that you guys should trade Morris you guys could definitely get a haul for him and hopefully a 1st and young player (I really wanna see the knicks do good).

Finally I think what you guys lack is what we lacked last year which is a true pg.

The team is 0-3 already, so throw him in there.

It's a big difference I suppose, but they're still signing middling free agents who are taking away minutes from young players as they aspire to become a bad team that just misses the playoffs, and still fail at that even. But idk, hopefully the young players they have will eventually develop into something good. I can hope.

Anyway, I know Phil Jackson wasn't good here, and frankly I thought the Knicks dysfunction accentuated his worst traits, but Steve Mills was the GM during that entire time too. Some people on this sub wanted to act like Mills was some kind of helpless victim who was being forced against his will to make stupid decisions but I think there's now enough evidence to say that Steve Mills had a big role in those losing years too since he's basically doing the same things now that he did then. The best thing you can say is that at least having Scott Perry write the contracts has saved the Knicks from being locked into cap hell for years and has allowed the Knicks to keep their draft picks moving forward. I didn't agree with the decision to give up on Porzingis, and that's a decision that has to come from the top, but I'm at least glad that it was Perry who carried out the orders to trade Porzingis and Melo because god only knows what kind of incredibly stupid shit Mills would have done if he was still the GM for those things. It's almost funny to me that Perry's first two years were spent basically trying to clean up the mess his boss made. It reminds me of when Donnie Walsh spent his first several years in NY trying to clean up the mess that Steve Mills made. It's really quite amazing and shows how good James Dolan is at hiring people who are really talented at wasting everyone's time.","[Post Game Thread] The Detroit Pistons (4-5) defeat the v New York Knicks (1-7), 122 - 102",https://www.reddit.com/r/NYKnicks/comments/dsquz3/post_game_thread_the_detroit_pistons_45_defeat/,,0.668308011,

LeBron James was way faster and had the strength of a locomotive lol. 

The only similarities I can see between LJ and RJ are:
1. Composure. RJ reminds me of rookie LJ in that department. He always looks level headed on the court. Even when playing poorly.

2. NBA ready body. Imagine when he hits the gym this off season. 


Now as far as RJ player comparisons. I'd say James Harden/Paul Pierce. And this is why I believe he will be deadly in this league soon. 

1. A very strong ability to draw fouls like Harden. Refs are swallowing their whistles because he's a rookie. He doesn't even complain a lot and get techs for this though. Which will only gain him more respect from refs.

2. Crafty with deceptive speed like Pierce. Not the most explosive. But can get to the rim at will. With the way he uses his body to create space.

I think the next few weeks, coach just gotta try different things. See what clicks, see who can play, etc. I don't think anything Frank or DSJ do from now till trade deadline will drastically change their value. They are who they are, we know it and the league knows it. A hot or cold streak over the next month ain't gonna change any of that.

I hope to god we get rid of both guys. For whatever we can get. Neither has any role to play in the long term success of this team, regardless of how young they are.

The offense and defense was fine. Not perfect but it was ok. This itch to fire him after every game is nuts to me. Wait out the season, see if we adjust the roster at the trade deadline and how they play from there. If you want to try out Mike Miller, fire Fiz in March. Otherwise give him until the end of the season and see if anything sticks. If not we gave Fiz a fair shake and we can find the new guy in June. The constant cycling of coaches is more damaging to player development than finishing the year with a mediocre one.

i believe the leverage thing was speculation though it is admittedly believable. reports were that he lost interest in us when we refused to give him any autonomy over basketball operations. if we are to believe that then we failed to not meet a GREAT coach's demands and secure that hire. either way, the choice shouldn't have come down to a group of coaches that included Fiz anyway.

we have an owner who has always loved big names and has always been willing to throw the bag at anyone. hiring Bud would have been an appropriate time for dolan to act like dolan.

And funny, you just criticized me for posting the box score, while posting the play-by-play, I can also do that.

* Frank gets the steal at 4:26.

* Frank misses a 19-foot jumper at 3:33.

* Luka gets an assist.

* Frank misses another 26-foot three point jumper at 2:59.

* Frank gets instantly benched.

* Doncic misses a 3 point stepback at 1:52 when Frank wasn't even in the game (why aren't you praising DSJ's defense?).

* Frank comes back for a defensive possession, we get scored on twice in a row.

* Frank scores the Free Throws after another mediocre 3 pts, 2 assists game in 18 minutes.

* RJ is the truth. I don't think you could have asked for a better two games from a rookie. He's done everything.  

* Not a huge fan of Randle's game, right now. Actually, a lot of the problems are similar to the knocks against RJ at Duke. He also needs to control his emotions; most of the mistakes are his fault, but he's taking it out on the refs.  

* Mitch has gotten a lot better in terms of understanding defensive rotations. I think he and Knox have a lot of work to do on the offensive end (you could see Portis/Trier trying to direct them), but they're playing better than last year. Knox is knocking down set threes at a high clip, which is great. He has a lot to learn from Morris (without the offensive fouls). 

* I don't really agree with Fizdale's rotations, but the sets are much better than last year. The players did a good job of attacking matchups, but I wished they created drives against the Nets with 5 fouls.  

What more can you really ask for, for a non-Playoff team? As a side note, I know the Nets casters are biased but I enjoyed the commentary. I also thought the Refs did a pretty good job, despite the slow game.","[Post-Game Thread] The Brooklyn Nets (1-1) defeat the New York Knicks (0-2), 113-109",https://www.reddit.com/r/NYKnicks/comments/dn7q58/postgame_thread_the_brooklyn_nets_11_defeat_the/,RJ; Mitch; Knox; Morris,0.807797952,

We don't need Elfrid dribbling the air out of the ball just to give it to Morris or Randle or RJ who are gonna dribble the air out of the ball cuz they're just waiting for Elfrid to give up on his drive. Frank actually looks for dudes in the right spots where they can get their offense from which is what we need. That's partially based on the fact that our roster is so poorly constructed but it's the situation that we're faced with. Why do you think Frank always ends up with a better +/- than him? It's not an accident. I'm not even arguing that Frank should start because I like him going up against second units to find his way but at the end of the day Elfrid aint it bro. Let Frank get minutes especially on nights like tonight where he really has it going. It made zero sense that we took Frank out when we were playing well and didn't let him come back in till Payton let us go down by 20 by the mid point in the 3rd quarter.

It also helps because although we want to be competitive, this group of guys playing well right now (Randle, Morris) isn't the core we need to compete for a championship. However, if they keep playing like this the Knicks might be able to get some really nice assets in trade returns at the deadline. Both of those players can clearly be of huge help to a team trying to push for a playoff run.

They were to make us a little better while we develop our youth and keep us in decent position in the next draft. Even IF we beat the projections we are still one of the 5 worst teams, right now it looks like we are as bad as the projections said. 

Somehow we played so well against Boston which makes laying an egg in a totally winnable game hurt so much more. Kings arent as bad as they seem though, they just beat the Jazz. Sometimes shots just dont fall (they certainly didnt tonight) and then effort all over is affected. It sucks but you dont dismantle everything because a rebuilding team had a bad game. 

 We dont have a starter quality PG and only 1 rim protector, who has a sprained finger. Morris should get all the shots he wants honestly. All our other vets seem to be in their own heads.

Is the front office calling these player rotations and not Mike Miller?

Surely it's Dolan, Mills and Perry asking for these 'vets' to play huge minutes and not giving the kids a chance to play and develop?

Why was Kenny signed? To sit on the bench?

Mitch Robinson, who has ridiculous potential has been looking below average lately.

He gets into foul trouble early? Fine, play him til he fouls out, it's not like he's starting or getting significant minutes anyway.

Im not a Knox fan (not a hater either) but he does have potential to be much better. At times he looks like he's never played basketball in his life but as he plays more, he is getting better.

Trier? I don't even know. Sometimes has some great shooting but can't d up to save his life.

No we do not have a point guard to run the show but I dont think RJ is the answer for that, even though hes doing a decent job because hes so good. RJ should be playing the 2 or 3 because thats what he has always played and hes a great rebounder. The biggest issue with Fiz is the offense looks AWFUL. Everything is kept outside the 3pt line and everyone is just standing around waiting for a pass with maybe 1 or 2 cuts per possession. Theres a lot of chucking the ball up and I havent exactly been a fan of his substitutions either. Hes also super inconsistent with giving guys minutes and his load management comment is just stupid. In a blowout loss RJ doesnt need to play 41 minutes.

I think putting in DSJ first was a bad look to the rest of the team imo. Dude didn't really make any argument to earn a 10 minute spot in preseason, and he got destroyed on defense and shot 3 bricks after Fiz preached defense. He's going to need to find better ways to pair the back court and front court to work to everyone's advantage. I would consider having Peyton start, DSJ to come in halfway through the first for energy, and have Frank start the 2nd with Trier and Knox and the rest because those 3 are comfortable playing together, the offense will run through those 2 and Portis, and Portis, Frank, and Taj will defend.

Portis was hot and Knox was literally open for a 3 every trip down the court but the team doesnt actively look for him for some reason.  Fiz took them both out and I almost jumped out my window. At least Fiz put Portis back in quickly.  But then it seemed like he again called a couple plays for Randle down the stretch smh. Those broken plays lead to a lucky pass to Portis and the W for the night. Im starting to think Fiz is taking money under the table to try and fuck up games for us. Every time were on a run or someone is hot, he tries to change things.  Randle is not good in iso situations. So why keep feeding him the ball late in the 4th?  We actually have a guy named Iso-Zo.

Good flow on offense though in the second half.","[Post-Game Thread] The Brooklyn Nets (1-1) defeat the New York Knicks (0-2), 113-109",https://www.reddit.com/r/NYKnicks/comments/dn7q58/postgame_thread_the_brooklyn_nets_11_defeat_the/,,0.908983697,

And Doris is a Knicks fan, just like all of us, so I always take her evaluations of our team and our players as especially meaningful. The jist of what she said on our young guys was:

* RJ needs to strengthen the parts of his game in offense that he was able to get by on at lower levels of competition (namely consistency in his jumper) before the more polished aspects of his game will really shine (getting to the rim).

* Frank needs to continue to be more aggressive in looking for his shot, which we're really only seeing him start to do (a reasonable take that isn't overly Stan-ing him).

* Knox really needs to get his shit together, because while his defense has shown slight improvement, his offense has regressed.","Post Game Thread: Knicks lose to the Pelicans (January 10, 2020)",https://www.reddit.com/r/NYKnicks/comments/en1kp2/post_game_thread_knicks_lose_to_the_pelicans/,,0.92209289,

The Knicks have to move on from Fizdale and hire a coach that has some semblance of running a modern offense and will develop the players.

Knicks have to find a way to bring in Joerger. 

This laughable constant dribble-handing off offense by the Knicks point guards and letting Randle run the offense is inexcusable.

Knicks have young players and they have to run.

Also, it's inexcusable the Knicks aren't running any screen plays by their point guards.

What are the Knicks doing?

The Knicks have to swallow the mistake that was signing Julius Randle because he's a black hole on offense right now, not something a young developing team needs.

I'd understand signing Randle if there was an offensive system in place like Gentry had in New Orleans but right now the Knicks are using Randle as the focal point of the offense which is a mistake. 

Even worse, not only the Knicks revolving their offensive schemes around Randle, for some reason they're allowing Randle to run the offense.

Why is Randle being tasked with constantly dribbling the ball up the court with no sense of urgency and halting the offense's momentum?

Stop this nonsense.

Bench Randle or change his role in the offense if he refuses.

If the Knicks signed Randle with the premise that he would be the cornerstone of the offense, scrap that promise right now and focus on the greater good of the team.

I'd rather watch some interchangeable, swingman screen plays with Ntilikina, Barrett, and even Trier. 

Also, when Robinson is on the floor, can the Knicks run more side pick-and-roll with him with some weak side action with Ellington, Trier, or Knox?

Enough with the shameful offense: the dribble hand offs, players weakly cutting to the rim because they know the ball carrier has no intention to make the pass to the cutter, allowing Randle to walk all over this team -- whether by design or not, the coach never calling for any screen plays with Ntilikina or Barrett, and the offensive stagnation that usually occurs in the fourth quarter.

Fizdale was not the right hire.

Stop stunting the development of the Knicks, especially that of Barrett.","[Post Game Thread] The Sacramento Kings (2-5) exterminate the @ New York Knicks (1-6), 113 - 92",https://www.reddit.com/r/NYKnicks/comments/draeuh/post_game_thread_the_sacramento_kings_25/,,0.960618638,

Top 10 picks are a massive asset in the NBA due to their trade value and to the fact that you can really get top-notch talent in the top ten.  We've done neither of those things with our picks. 

Frank isn't a top 10 talent and players of his ilk are available way later in the draft or as FA's for cheap.  Knox was strange to me because he was a late riser in the draft even though he had a very lackluster collegiate career.  I'm sure he would've been available in the late lottery.  

RJ will be fine, he's just in a shitty situation.  We're asking so much from him way too early in his career.  Mitch, I'm still mum on, which I'm sure isn't popular on this sub.

Ultimately if a deal like the one for Harkless and a first came along for Morris I would do that, and Id move Ellington and/or Bullock for 2nds or young prospects that havent panned out if I could, but if you go too far down that road and you trade everyone, depending on what you get back, you are left with a team like we had last year and some picks that might never be anything special.  I think there is a case to make that having the right leaders and playing more competitive games outweighs the value of adding another first. The quantity of minutes might be reduced but the quality of the minutes they do play is better.  

I think fans overrate these late picks and get caught up in the process sixers while ignoring teams like the nuggets. In the end watching this team play together is great and at least makes me feel like the FO did actually have a plan when they put it together. Ill be ok with whatever they do in the trade period as long as its not going all in on Kevin Love (which I dont think they would do).",[Post Game Thread] Knicks (7-21) demolish the Atlanta Hawks (6-22) at home for the franchise's highest scoring game in 39 years,https://www.reddit.com/r/NYKnicks/comments/ec6kou/post_game_thread_knicks_721_demolish_the_atlanta/,,0.999614702,
