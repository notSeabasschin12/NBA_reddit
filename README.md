# NBA_reddit
The purpose of this project is to analyze data from Reddit post-game NBA threads to see how accurate comments are in giving priase to those basketball players who deserve it. When Redditors discuss recent basketball games, they often reference certain players in their comments and provide their own opinions on whether that player performed well or poorly. However, the amount of credit that a Redditor provides to a basketball player might not reflect their actual performance in the game. One way to see whether or not the Redditor's praise or criticism of a player is reasonable is examining the statistics of the game. Through combining the player's statistics and the Redditor's comments, we will try to provide insight into whether or not a Redditor's analysis of a basketball game provides an accurate interpretation of the player's actual performance.
